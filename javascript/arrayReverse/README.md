## Approach & Efficiency

1. Reading the problem and reading again to make sure I understand.

2. Thinking about what tests would help me make sure it functions properly.

3. Drawing/writing a visualization of how the problem will be solved.

4. Writing out the algorithm in psuedocode

5. Big O notation

6. Write out the actual code.

7. Go step by step through the code to ensure correct output along each step.
